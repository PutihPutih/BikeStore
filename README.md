# BikeStores Sample Database SQL Scripts
This repository contains three SQL scripts that can be used with the BikeStores sample database. Here's a brief description of each file:

1. create objects.sql
This script contains SQL statements to create the objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.) in the BikeStores sample database.

2. drop all objects.sql
This script contains SQL statements to drop all objects in the BikeStores sample database. Use this script if you need to start fresh with an empty database.

3. load data.sql
This script contains SQL statements to load sample data into the BikeStores sample database.

Note: You will need to have a compatible database management system installed to use these scripts. Also, make sure to review and modify the scripts as necessary before executing them, especially if you plan to use them in a production environment.
